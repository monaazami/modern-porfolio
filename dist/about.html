             <p>After 15 hours my flight landed in Heathrow airport in December 2010. from the 
                 first moment I stepped out of the plane I knew a new chapter in my life had 
                 begun. As we drove towards my friend’s house all my life came before me as if 
                 I was watching a movie in which I was the star. I remembered the day I became 
                 a mother and gave up a career in graphic design which had lasted 7 years  for 
                 a more important job. a job which changed me forever. After 24 hours I realised 
                 that I had given birth to a miracle. <a class="mySon" target="_blank" href="https://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/health/he-had-a-maximum-of-just-24-hours-to-live-hartlepool-boy-with-unique-heart-condition-defies-doctors-1-6649043">My son </a>was diagnosed with multiple heart 
                 defects some of which were so rare not every doctor had heard of. As My son’s 
                 medical treatment advanced I got a chance to connect with people who had 
                 experienced tragedy and despair. At that point I realised I could relate and 
                 understand them and even help them overcome their issues as I had passed that 
                 crossroad between falling into despair or moving forward and making my life
                 better. I volunteered in a charity organisation whose mission was to provide 
                 refugees and asylum seekers with basic education and support. After a while 
                 I noticed in order to help others I needed to improve myself so I started an 
                 art and design course in Teesside University. once I moved to London from 
                 Hartlepool  I found myself being swarmed with opportunities.<a class="codeYourFuture" target="_blank" href="https://codeyourfuture.io"> Code your Future </a>
                 , a newborn charity dedicated to help people like me to make a career in programming, 
                 seemed the right choice. It was never enough just to rely on what I was taught and I 
                 realised I have to study on my own. If I had learned one thing along my journey is 
                 that there is no end to learning and what makes me stronger is taking on new chanllenges.
